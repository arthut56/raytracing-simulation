This program runs a raytracing simulation where "light rays" are emitted from a source. 

This source may be moved around the screen using `left mouse key + drag`.

The simulation has 2 basic shapes, a circle and a square. 

You can relocate the circle using `key S`, and it will move to your cursor position.

You cna relocate the rectangle using `key A`, and it will move to your cursor position
