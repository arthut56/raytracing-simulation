This program runs a raytracing simulation where "light rays" are emitted from a source. The simulation has 2 basic shapes that function as obstacles, a circle and a square. 


The "sun" may be moved around the screen using `left mouse key + drag` to see how the light rays interact around the shapes.

You can relocate the circle using `key S`, and it will move to your cursor position.

You cna relocate the rectangle using `key A`, and it will move to your cursor position
